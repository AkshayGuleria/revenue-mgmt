# B2B Enterprise Revenue Management Backend System

## Problem Statement

Currently, the Revenue app only displays mock invoice data with no backend system:
- No real database for enterprise accounts, contracts, or products
- No contract-based billing logic
- No payment tracking or processing
- No hierarchical account structures (parent companies with subsidiaries)
- No purchase order management
- No commitment-based billing (annual/multi-year contracts)
- No approval workflows for enterprise deals
- No billing automation or scheduled jobs

This prevents the Revenue app from being a production-ready B2B Enterprise billing system.

**Current State:**
```javascript
// Mock data in frontend
const mockInvoices = [
  { id: 'inv-001', amount: 5000, status: 'paid' }
];
```

**Need:**
A full-featured B2B Enterprise revenue management backend with:
- Hierarchical account management (parent companies with subsidiaries)
- Contract management with commitment-based pricing
- Seat-based licensing and volume discounts
- Purchase order workflows
- Custom payment terms (Net 30/60/90)
- Multi-year deals with fixed pricing
- Credit limit management
- Quarterly/Annual billing in advance
- Enterprise reporting and analytics
- SLA-based billing adjustments

## Current State

**Frontend:**
- Revenue app with dashboard, invoice list, invoice detail views
- Mock data via shared API layer
- No real backend

**No Backend:**
- No database
- No API server
- No billing engine
- No payment processing

## Proposed Solution

Build a **B2B Enterprise Revenue Management Backend System** in phases, starting with core enterprise billing features and expanding incrementally. The system is designed for B2B SaaS companies selling to enterprise customers with complex contracts, hierarchical account structures, and custom payment terms.

### Technology Stack

**Backend Framework:** Express.js (Node.js)
- Consistent with auth-server architecture
- Team already familiar with Express
- Excellent ecosystem for billing logic

**Database:** PostgreSQL
- Relational data (customers, products, invoices)
- ACID compliance (critical for financial data)
- JSON support for flexible schemas
- Mature and battle-tested

**Scalability & Performance:**
- **PM2** - Process manager for clustering and monitoring
- **Node.js Cluster** - Multi-process for I/O-bound API scaling
- **Worker Threads** - Multi-threading for CPU-bound tasks (PDF, tax calc)
- **BullMQ** - Queue system for async jobs (Redis-backed)
- **Redis** - Job queues, caching, session storage

**Additional Services:**
- Stripe/PayPal SDK for payment processing
- pdfkit or puppeteer for PDF generation
- Nodemailer for email notifications

**Key Architectural Decisions (B2B Enterprise Focus):**

1. **Cluster Mode (PM2)** - Scales I/O-bound API requests across CPU cores
   - B2B workload: Fewer concurrent users but more complex operations
   - Finance teams accessing dashboards, reports, contract management

2. **Worker Threads** - Parallelizes CPU-intensive B2B tasks
   - PDF generation (complex enterprise invoices with line items)
   - Tax calculations (multi-jurisdiction, multiple tax authorities)
   - Consolidated billing (hierarchical aggregation across subsidiaries)
   - Volume discount calculations (tiered pricing rules)

3. **Queue System (BullMQ)** - Decouples heavy/scheduled work from API
   - **Contract billing jobs** - Scheduled based on contract terms (monthly/quarterly/annual)
   - **Consolidated billing** - Roll-up invoices across parent-child accounts
   - **Renewal alerts** - Proactive notifications 90/60/30 days before expiration
   - **Webhook delivery** - Enterprise event notifications with retry logic
   - **Approval workflows** - Purchase order approvals, large deal reviews
   - Better for scheduled batch operations than real-time event processing

4. **Dedicated Workers** - Separate processes for different B2B job types
   - Contract billing workers (scheduled invoice generation)
   - Consolidated billing workers (hierarchical aggregation)
   - PDF workers (enterprise-branded invoices)
   - Tax workers (jurisdiction-based calculations)
   - Email workers (billing contacts, renewal alerts)
   - Webhook workers (enterprise integrations)

5. **PostgreSQL with B2B Optimizations**
   - **ACID compliance** - Critical for financial data integrity
   - **Recursive CTEs** - For hierarchical account queries
   - **Database indices** - On parent_account_id, contract_id, po_number, end_date
   - **Database views** - Pre-aggregated roll-up reporting
   - **Audit logging** - All mutations logged for SOC2/GDPR compliance
   - **Transaction support** - Multi-table operations (invoice + items + payment application)

6. **Redis** - Fast job queue and caching layer
   - Queue management for async B2B operations
   - Cache product catalog and volume discount tiers
   - Cache exchange rates (updated daily)
   - Session storage for API authentication

7. **B2B-Specific Architectural Patterns**
   - **Credit limit enforcement** - Check before invoice generation (prevent over-billing)
   - **Approval workflows** - Multi-stage approvals for purchase orders and large deals
   - **Audit trail** - Comprehensive logging of all financial operations
   - **Webhook delivery** - Enterprise event notifications with HMAC signatures
   - **Data export** - Integration with finance systems (QuickBooks, NetSuite, Xero)
   - **Hierarchical queries** - Efficient parent-child account traversal

### Phased Approach

**Phase 1: Foundation** (Weeks 1-2)
- Enterprise account CRUD with hierarchical support
- Contract management (single and multi-year deals)
- Product catalog with seat-based pricing
- Manual invoice creation

- PDF invoice generation

**Phase 3: Hierarchical Accounts** (Weeks 5-6)
- Parent-child company relationships
- Consolidated billing for subsidiaries
- Roll-up reporting across account hierarchies
- Multi-location support
- Shared contracts across subsidiaries

**Phase 4: Enterprise Operations** (Weeks 7-9)
- Purchase order management and tracking
- Credit limit and credit hold management
- Approval workflows for large deals
- Payment processing and reconciliation
- Multi-currency support
- Tax calculation by jurisdiction

**Phase 5: Analytics & Optimization** (Weeks 10-12)
- Enterprise analytics dashboard (ARR, MRR, churn)
- Contract renewal tracking and forecasting
- SLA-based billing adjustments
- Custom billing rules engine
- Webhooks for enterprise events
- Payment gateway integration (Stripe/ACH)
- Audit logging for compliance

  port: process.env.REDIS_PORT || 6379,
  maxRetriesPerRequest: null
});

// PDF Generation Queue
export const pdfQueue = new Queue('pdf-generation', {
  connection,
  defaultJobOptions: {
    attempts: 3,
    backoff: {
      type: 'exponential',
      delay: 2000
    }
  }
});

// Tax Calculation Queue
export const taxQueue = new Queue('tax-calculation', {
  connection,
  defaultJobOptions: {
    attempts: 3,

  }
});

// Billing Queue (scheduled jobs)
export const billingQueue = new Queue('billing', {
  connection,
  defaultJobOptions: {
    attempts: 2
  }
});
```

**API Server with Queue Integration:**
```javascript
// src/server.js
import express from 'express';
import { pdfQueue, taxQueue, emailQueue } from './config/queues.js';
import { pool } from './config/database.js';  // Connection pooling

const app = express();

// I/O-bound route (fast, handled by cluster)
app.get('/api/invoices', async (req, res) => {
  const invoices = await pool.query('SELECT * FROM invoices');
  res.json(invoices.rows);
});

// CPU-bound route → queue it (non-blocking)
app.post('/api/invoices/:id/pdf', async (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params;

  // Add job to queue (returns immediately)
  const job = await pdfQueue.add('generate-pdf', {
    invoiceId: id,
    userId: req.user.id
  });

  res.json({
    jobId: job.id,
    status: 'queued',
    message: 'PDF generation started. Poll /api/jobs/:id for status'
  });
});

// Check job status
app.get('/api/jobs/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const job = await pdfQueue.getJob(req.params.id);

  if (!job) {
    return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Job not found' });
  }

  const state = await job.getState();

  if (state === 'completed') {
    const result = job.returnvalue;
    res.json({
      status: 'completed',
      pdfUrl: result.url,
      completedAt: job.finishedOn
    });
  } else if (state === 'failed') {
    res.json({
      status: 'failed',
      error: job.failedReason
    });
  } else {
    res.json({
      status: state,  // waiting, active, delayed
      progress: job.progress
    });
  }
});

// Graceful shutdown
process.on('SIGTERM', async () => {
  console.log('SIGTERM received, closing server gracefully');

  await pool.end();  // Close database connections
  await pdfQueue.close();
  await taxQueue.close();
  await emailQueue.close();

  process.exit(0);
});

app.listen(5177);
```

**PDF Worker with Worker Threads:**
```javascript
// src/workers/pdf-worker.js
import { Worker as BullWorker } from 'bullmq';
import { Worker as ThreadWorker } from 'worker_threads';
import { pdfQueue } from '../config/queues.js';
import path from 'path';

const THREAD_POOL_SIZE = parseInt(process.env.THREAD_POOL_SIZE) || 2;
const threadPool = [];

// Initialize thread pool
for (let i = 0; i < THREAD_POOL_SIZE; i++) {
  threadPool.push(null);  // Lazy initialization
}

function getAvailableThreadSlot() {
  return threadPool.findIndex(worker => worker === null);
}

async function generatePDFInThread(invoiceId) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const slotIndex = getAvailableThreadSlot();

    const worker = new ThreadWorker(
      path.resolve('./src/threads/pdf-generator.js'),
      { workerData: { invoiceId } }
    );

    threadPool[slotIndex] = worker;

    worker.on('message', (result) => {
      threadPool[slotIndex] = null;  // Free slot
      resolve(result);
    });

    worker.on('error', (err) => {
      threadPool[slotIndex] = null;
      reject(err);
    });

    worker.on('exit', (code) => {
      if (code !== 0) {
        threadPool[slotIndex] = null;
        reject(new Error(`Worker stopped with exit code ${code}`));
      }
    });
  });
}

// BullMQ worker (processes jobs from queue)
const pdfWorker = new BullWorker('pdf-generation', async (job) => {
  const { invoiceId } = job.data;

  console.log(`[PDF Worker ${process.pid}] Processing invoice ${invoiceId}`);

  // Update progress
  await job.updateProgress(10);

  // Offload to Worker Thread
  const { pdfBuffer } = await generatePDFInThread(invoiceId);

  await job.updateProgress(80);

  // Upload to S3 (or save to disk)
  const url = await uploadPDF(pdfBuffer, invoiceId);

  await job.updateProgress(100);

  return { url, invoiceId };
}, {
  connection: { host: 'localhost', port: 6379 },
  concurrency: THREAD_POOL_SIZE  // Process N jobs in parallel
});

pdfWorker.on('completed', (job, result) => {
  console.log(`[PDF Worker] Job ${job.id} completed: ${result.url}`);
});

pdfWorker.on('failed', (job, err) => {
  console.error(`[PDF Worker] Job ${job.id} failed:`, err.message);
});

// Graceful shutdown
process.on('SIGTERM', async () => {
  console.log('SIGTERM received, closing PDF worker gracefully');
  await pdfWorker.close();
  process.exit(0);
});
```

**Worker Thread (actual PDF generation):**
```javascript
// src/threads/pdf-generator.js
import { parentPort, workerData } from 'worker_threads';
import PDFDocument from 'pdfkit';
import { pool } from '../config/database.js';

const { invoiceId } = workerData;

async function generatePDF() {
  // Fetch invoice data
  const invoice = await pool.query(
    'SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE id = $1',
    [invoiceId]
  );

  const items = await pool.query(
    'SELECT * FROM invoice_items WHERE invoice_id = $1',
    [invoiceId]
  );

  // CPU-intensive PDF generation
  const doc = new PDFDocument();
  const chunks = [];

  doc.on('data', (chunk) => chunks.push(chunk));
  doc.on('end', () => {
    const pdfBuffer = Buffer.concat(chunks);
    parentPort.postMessage({ pdfBuffer });
  });

  // Build PDF (heavy computation)
  doc.fontSize(20).text('Invoice', { align: 'center' });
  doc.fontSize(12).text(`Invoice #: ${invoice.rows[0].invoice_number}`);

  // Add line items
  items.rows.forEach(item => {
    doc.text(`${item.description}: $${item.amount}`);
  });

  doc.end();
}

// Run and send result back
generatePDF().catch(err => {
  parentPort.postMessage({ error: err.message });
});
```

**Database Connection Pooling:**
```javascript
// src/config/database.js
import pkg from 'pg';
const { Pool } = pkg;

export const pool = new Pool({
  host: process.env.DB_HOST || 'localhost',
  port: process.env.DB_PORT || 5432,
  database: process.env.DB_NAME || 'revenue_db',
  user: process.env.DB_USER || 'postgres',
  password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
  max: 5,  // Max 5 connections per process
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000
});

// B2B Enterprise connection pooling:
// Total connections: 4 API workers × 5 = 20
//                    + 2 Contract Billing workers × 5 = 10
//                    + 2 Consolidated Billing workers × 5 = 10
//                    + 3 PDF workers × 5 = 15
//                    + 2 tax workers × 5 = 10
//                    + 2 email workers × 5 = 10
//                    + 1 renewal alert worker × 5 = 5
//                    + 2 webhook workers × 5 = 10
//                    = 90 total (within PostgreSQL limits)
```

### Integration with Existing System

**Auth Server Integration:**
```javascript
// middleware/auth.js
import axios from 'axios';

export async function validateSession(req, res, next) {
  const sessionToken = req.headers.authorization?.replace('Bearer ', '');

  if (!sessionToken) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'No session token' });
  }

  try {
    const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:5176/auth/validate', {
      sessionToken
    });

    if (!response.data.valid) {
      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid session' });
    }

    req.user = response.data.user;
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Auth validation failed' });
  }
}
```

**Revenue Frontend Migration:**
```javascript
// packages/revenue-app/src/api/invoices.js (updated)

const API_BASE = import.meta.env.VITE_REVENUE_API_URL || 'http://localhost:5177';

export const invoicesApi = {
  async getAll() {
    const sessionToken = localStorage.getItem('sessionToken');
    const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/api/invoices`, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${sessionToken}`
      }
    });
    return response.json();
  },

  async getById(id) {
    const sessionToken = localStorage.getItem('sessionToken');
    const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/api/invoices/${id}`, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${sessionToken}`
      }
    });
    return response.json();
  },

  async create(invoice) {
    const sessionToken = localStorage.getItem('sessionToken');
    const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/api/invoices`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${sessionToken}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(invoice)
    });

**B2B Enterprise Advantages:**
- ✅ **Contract-first approach** - Built around multi-year enterprise deals
- ✅ **Hierarchical accounts** - Parent companies with multiple subsidiaries
- ✅ **Seat-based licensing** - Standard B2B SaaS pricing model
- ✅ **Purchase order support** - Enterprise procurement workflows
- ✅ **Credit management** - Enterprise credit limits and holds
- ✅ **Consolidated billing** - Roll-up invoices across subsidiaries
- ✅ **Volume discounts** - Automatic tiered pricing
- ✅ **Modern tech stack** (PostgreSQL, Express, React)
- ✅ **Hybrid scalability** - Cluster + Worker Threads + Queues
- ✅ **API-first design** - Easy integration with CRM/ERP systems

### B2C Event-Based Billing (Future Phase 6+)

After establishing the B2B Enterprise foundation, the system can be **extended to support B2C** use cases where events are billed as they occur:

**Future B2C Extensions:**
- Usage-based (metered) billing for API calls, storage, bandwidth
- Event ingestion API for real-time usage tracking
- Rating engine to convert usage to charges
- Pay-as-you-go pricing models
- Self-service customer portal
- Automated subscription upgrades/downgrades
- Proration calculations
- Trial periods and free tiers

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Phase 1-5:** Build robust B2B Enterprise billing foundation
2. **Phase 6+ (Future):** Add B2C event tables (`usage_records`, `usage_events`)
3. Add rating engine for usage-to-charge conversion
4. Add self-service portal and subscription management
5. Keep B2B and B2C models separate but share common infrastructure

**Why B2B First?**
- ✅ Higher average revenue per customer (ARPC)
- ✅ More predictable revenue (annual contracts)
- ✅ Simpler to implement (no real-time event processing)
- ✅ Better foundation for future B2C extension
- ✅ Matches typical SaaS company growth trajectory (B2B → B2B+B2C)

## Security Considerations

1. **Financial Data Protection:**
   - All financial data in PostgreSQL (ACID compliance)
   - No sensitive data in logs
   - Encrypt data at rest (production)
   - Audit trail for all financial operations

2. **API Security:**
   - Session-based authentication (via auth-server)
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Input validation on all endpoints
   - SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)

3. **Payment Data:**
   - Never store credit card numbers (PCI compliance)
   - Use Stripe for card storage (tokenization)
   - Secure webhook signature verification

4. **Multi-Tenant Isolation:**
   - Row-level security in PostgreSQL
   - Tenant ID in all queries
   - Prevent cross-tenant data access

## Performance Considerations (B2B Enterprise)

1. **Database Optimization for B2B:**
   - **Hierarchical indices** - Composite index on `(parent_account_id, status)` for account tree queries
   - **Contract indices** - Index on `(end_date, auto_renew)` for renewal tracking
   - **Invoice indices** - Composite index on `(account_id, contract_id, status, due_date)`
   - **PO indices** - Index on `(po_number, status)` for procurement workflows
   - **Recursive CTEs** - Optimized queries for parent-child account traversal
   - **Materialized views** - Pre-aggregated ARR/MRR calculations (refreshed daily)
   - **Connection pooling** - Max 5 connections per worker process (90 total)
   - **Query optimization** - EXPLAIN ANALYZE for complex hierarchical queries
   - **Partial indices** - On active contracts, unpaid invoices (reduce index size)

2. **Caching Strategy for B2B:**
   - **Product catalog** - Cache seat-based pricing and volume discount tiers (1 hour TTL)
   - **Exchange rates** - Cache daily rates from external API (24 hour TTL)
   - **Account hierarchy** - Cache parent-child relationships (15 min TTL, invalidate on update)
   - **Volume discount rules** - Cache tiered pricing calculations (1 hour TTL)
   - **Tax rates** - Cache jurisdiction-based tax rates (24 hour TTL)
   - **Credit limits** - Cache account credit limit checks (5 min TTL)
   - **Contract terms** - Cache active contract details (30 min TTL)

3. **Scalability for B2B Workloads:**
   - **Vertical scaling first** - B2B benefits from powerful single server (complex queries)
   - **Read replicas** - For analytics and reporting queries (avoid blocking writes)
   - **Database sharding** - By account region if needed (North America, EMEA, APAC)
   - **Job queues** - Decouple heavy batch operations (contract billing, consolidated invoicing)
   - **Scheduled jobs** - Off-peak batch processing for monthly/quarterly billing runs
   - **Connection pooling** - Balance across worker processes to avoid connection exhaustion
   - **Query timeouts** - Set reasonable limits on complex hierarchical queries (30s max)

4. **Batch Operation Optimization:**
   - **Contract billing** - Process in batches of 500 contracts per job
   - **Consolidated billing** - Parallel processing by parent account
   - **PDF generation** - Queue-based with Worker Threads (48 PDFs/sec throughput)
   - **Email delivery** - Batch send in groups of 100 (avoid SMTP throttling)
   - **Renewal alerts** - Daily batch job for contracts expiring in 90/60/30 days
   - **Payment reconciliation** - Batch matching with fuzzy logic (invoice # + amount + date)

5. **Hierarchical Query Optimization:**
   - **Limit depth** - Cap account hierarchy at 5 levels (prevent infinite recursion)
   - **Materialized path** - Store full parent path for faster lookups
   - **Adjacency list** - Primary storage method with parent_account_id
   - **Closure table** - Optional secondary table for complex hierarchy queries
   - **Query caching** - Cache recursive CTE results for frequently accessed hierarchies

6. **Month-End Performance:**
   - **Peak load planning** - Most B2B billing occurs on 1st of month
   - **Stagger billing** - Spread contract billing across days 1-5 of month
   - **Pre-generate PDFs** - Create invoices 2-3 days before send date
   - **Database backups** - Schedule before month-end billing runs
   - **Monitoring** - Alert on job queue depth, database CPU, connection pool exhaustion

## Testing Strategy

**Phase 1:**
- Unit tests for account and contract API endpoints
- Integration tests with PostgreSQL
- Contract validation testing (dates, commitment values)
- Payment terms calculation testing
- API contract testing

**Phase 2:**
- Contract-based invoice generation testing
- Seat-based pricing calculation accuracy
- Volume discount rule testing
- Job scheduler testing
- Email delivery testing (mock SMTP)
- PDF generation with enterprise branding testing

**Phase 3:**
- Hierarchical account relationship testing
- Consolidated billing logic testing
- Roll-up reporting accuracy testing
- Parent-child contract inheritance testing

**Phase 4+:**
- Purchase order workflow testing
- Credit limit enforcement testing
- Payment reconciliation accuracy
- Multi-currency conversion testing
- Tax calculation by jurisdiction testing
- Payment gateway integration testing (Stripe/ACH test mode)
